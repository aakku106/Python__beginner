# A conversation between two beings
being1 = input("What's the name of 1st being ? ")
being2 = input('"Enter the name of 2nd being"')
print(being1,': Ohayyo ' , being2 , ' I am ' , being1)
print(being2,':what the hek go away uou üêí ')

# Another interesting example is making a tree
print('   *')
print('  ***')
print(' *****')
print('*******')
print("  ||")

# OR

x = input('how shall the tre look')
print('   ',x)
print('  '+x,x,x)

print(x,x,x,x,x,x)
print("    ||")

# This above example takes any string and shape it like a tree 
# In this example i have used , and + if they were same thing, cause typecasting is not needed here, everything is string here 
# + concatenates and , just shop things one by one 

age: int = 16;
name = 'Aakku';
height: float = 5.6;
print('My name is',name,'and my age is',age,'and my height is',height)
# This is how you can print multiple things in one line, you can use , to separate them, and it will automatically add a space between them
# You can also use + to concatenate them, but you will have to typecast them to string, because + can't concatenate different types
print(f'My name is {name} and my age is {age} and my height is {height}')
# You can also use f string, which is the most efficient way to print multiple things in one line
# You can use {} to add variables in the string, and it will automatically add them in the string same like $@ in C#
